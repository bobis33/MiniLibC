# B-ASM-400 - MinilibC

## Description

The objective of this project is to create a dynamic ELF library to replace (to a certain extent) the standard
C library you use every day on your system.
Thanks to the bootstrap, you are now able to replace some functions with your own implementations
through a dynamic library (which is called weak binding).
